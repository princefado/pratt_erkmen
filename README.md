This is our CSC106 Final Project, created by Gabriel Pratt and Kerem Erkmen. This is a simple paint-by-number program, in which you can choose from three different options to create a cute piece of pixel art. Click on one of the options to get started, then click on the numbered buttons to change your fill color.
